We constantly monitor access to our system for security reasons and to help our developer community and enterprise partners have the best possible experience.</p>
    <p>	We recently noticed a rather common error in your application that will prevent some of your users from being able to make connections with the sessions you create.</p>
    <p>	Simply put, when a session is created (using an API Key) it can only be accessed by an end user that has a corresponding token (generated with the same API Key).  We have seen multiple instances of your clients trying to connect to your sessions where the API Keys do not match.  Your clients should be receiving an error message indicating that the token is invalid for that session.</p>
    <p>	Our experience is that this usually happens in error and is easily remedied by picking one API Key and ensuring that it is used consistently.</p>
    <p>	To check that your API key and session will work together, please use our Credential Validator. This tool will tell you whether the API key and session ID you're using are compatible. Please make sure to <strong>fill in all four form fields in this tool</strong>.</p>
