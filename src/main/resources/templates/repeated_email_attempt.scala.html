            Hi there,
            <br>
            <br>

            We’ve received your request to create a new OpenTok account but there is already an account registered to this email address.  If you are trying to recover access to an existing account, you can  <a href="@reset_password_link">
            reset your password here</a>.
            <br>
            <br>

            If you did not attempt to register again, don’t worry - your account has not been accessed by anyone else.  You can continue to use your account as normal.

            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you,
            <br>
            <br>
